# Automatic-Maose-Klicker-
自己和朋友随便写的一个鼠标连点器 不会啥语言发现C++可以实现就玩一玩 

**by sqrtsqrxlxl & xlswmn**

放到github上面希望可以帮助到有需求的人。（什

两位随手写一下主要只是想随便玩玩。两位都是初三狗，一个大菜逼和一个大佬。（迫真）

所以恳请业内人士/同年级大佬/OIer不要太过反感……

虽然遵循MIT liscence，但还是希望不要用在联机游戏上，也希望不要商用。一是代码肯定和狗屎一样烂，二是我们写这个鼠标连点器并不是为了服务于联机游戏作弊的，请各位好自为之！
我们只提供代码，如果您破坏了游戏平衡性导致游玩乐趣下降/被封号，我们不负任何责任！

A simple automatic clicker by me and my friend. devcpp used. Written just for fun. Plz don't be too serious

**Produced by sqrtsqrxlxl & xlswmn**

We hope that this mouse clicker can help those who have a need on this.

Both of us are(were) currently in Junior-3. (in 2020-10)

We wrote this purely because we had personal need for an ~~Fuli~~ Automatic Mouse Clicker. Plz professional programmers/OIers don't be too serious on this. You can say that we wrote this just for fun.

Though this program follows the MIT liscence, we sincerely hope that you do not use this neither on online games nor for commercial use. 
First of all our code should suck (noob), secondly we wrote this **not** because of we had a need of cheating on some online games, nor should it serve as a cheating file/program. Think twice before using this! We only Provide the code, and we are not responsible if you got banned/broke game balance which resulted in your poor game experience.
